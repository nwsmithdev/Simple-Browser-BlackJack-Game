♦️ Blackjack Game ♠️

Welcome to Blackjack, a simple card game built using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. 
The objective is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it, and this game simulates a single-player version where the user is able to hit (get new card) or stay. 

How It Works: 

When the game is initially loaded, the user will be asked to enter their name. 
This will display at the top of the screen, along with the starting chip amount (currently set to $0, trying to add functionality and a rewards tracking system later). 
The user will start with two cards and can then decide whether to draw another card by clicking the "New Card" button. 
The sum of the cards is continuously updated, and the game will inform the user whether they can keep playing, have achieved Blackjack, or exceeded the required score. 

Planned Improvements: 
A betting system in which the user can place chips and play against the dealer. 
Implementation of player win/loss chip adjustments. 
More detailed animations and UI elements.
